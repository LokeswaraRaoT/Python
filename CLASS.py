#CLASS : Class is a blue print of things [functions, variables]. 
#Ex: Just like plan of building with floors, kitchen, cupboards, bathrooms. 
#We have to call the methods inside of the class by using "instance object".
class employee:
	my_var = "dummy"
	
my_cls_ins = employee() #my_cls_ins stores class "employee" object

print(my_cls_ins.my_var)
